# Private Events

This is a project creating a backend similar to [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) for [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations). Users can sign up and create events which other users can view and attend. It keeps track of upcoming events and past events.

This project allowed me to work with a database, different model associations and how to handle a creatively named `has_many :through` association.

Because this was a more backend focused learning project I used a free theme for the design from [Minamalistic Design](http://www.minimalistic-design.net).
