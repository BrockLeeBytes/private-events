# Private Events

This is a project creating a backend similar to [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) for [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations).

This project allowed me to work with different model associations and how to handle a creatively named '''ruby has_many :through''' association.

Because this was a more backend focused learning project I used a free theme for the design.
